TODO
1. Grouping tags so that we don't have to add tags manually
2. Tag hierarchy or nest. Eg timeline tag is only used in unreal engine then it means that it should not show up in ALL tags list. A tag will show up in ALL tags if its used in many places. Nested tags do not show
3. using space instead of "," to register tag in FE.
4. for videos we can skip pressing spacebar to add it to list of there is something in input field
5. searching tags ignore case
6. Redo the whole thing in RUST
